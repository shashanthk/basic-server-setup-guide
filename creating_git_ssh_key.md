## Creating SSH keys for GitHub and Bitbucket

1. Open terminal change directory to `.ssh`

		cd ~/.ssh

	If you're on Windows, open Git bash and type the above command would open the path

		C:\Users\<user_name>\.ssh

	If you're on Mac or Linux, it would open the `.ssh` directory in the user's `home` path.
	
		
2. Generate SSH key by issuing the following command.

		ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "yourgit@email.com" -f id_file_name

		
	Here, the `-f` paramter creates 2 files with the name you mentioned. 1 is the private key and another one is the public key.

		id_file_name
		id_file_name.pub

	`-C` adds a comment into the public key generated. Which is your email ID in this case. This is completely optional.


3. Create a `config` file inside the `.ssh` directory and tell the Git host address, git user, and SSH key to be used while accessing the Git services.

		touch config

4. Open the `config` file in your favorite text editor and add the following lines.

		# Github configuration

		Host user-github
        	HostName github.com
        	User git
        	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_file_name_for_github

		# Bitbucket configuration

		Host user-bitbucket
        	HostName bitbucket.org
        	User git
        	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_file_name_for_bitbucket

	Save and exit from the editor.

>**Note**: In some of the ISPs, the above configuration will not work. You receive an error message like "ssh: connect to host user-github port 22: Connection refused". If you face such error, try with the below config

	# Github configuration

	Host user-github
        HostName ssh.github.com
        User git
        Port 443
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_file_name_for_github

5. Copy the `id_file_name.pub` file content and paste it to your Github account.

	For Github, follow the link https://github.com/settings/keys

	Bitbucket,	https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/ssh-keys/

6. Test newly added SSH configuration.

		ssh -T git@user-github

7. If you don't get any error from the above command, the authentication worked. Now, you are good to use SSH tunnel to git operation.

8. While cloning the new repo, use command linke below

		git clone git@user-github:some_user_name/project_repo.git

>Notice the `git@user-github:` before repo URL

>**Note**: If you receive an error like "Host key verification failed", run below command to get rid off.

	ssh-keygen -f "~/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "[host_address_here]"
